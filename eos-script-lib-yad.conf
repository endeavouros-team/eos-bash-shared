## RATE_MIRRORS_MAX_DELAY_ARCH is the max acceptable delay in seconds
## since the last time a mirror has been synced. It is used only when ranking
## the Arch mirrors with the 'rate-mirrors' program in Welcome.
## Usually the range of reasonable values is somewhere between 60 and 3600.
## The smaller the value, the less mirrors will match.
## The bigger the value, the more mirrors will match.
## If you want recently updated mirrors, use a small value (but not too small).
## If no mirrors match, increase the value.
## (Note that rate-mirrors defaults to 86400 seconds.)
#
RATE_MIRRORS_MAX_DELAY_ARCH=3600   # seconds

## WELCOME_RATE_MIRRORS_COMMAND lets you specify all options for the rate-mirrors command (to be used for ranking Arch mirrors).
## Tip: consider using option '--protocol https' as well.
## NOTE: in 'welcome' version 25.10.2-1 variable WELCOME_RATE_MIRRORS_COMMAND is no more supported due to implementation change!
#
#WELCOME_RATE_MIRRORS_COMMAND="rate-mirrors arch --max-delay=$RATE_MIRRORS_MAX_DELAY_ARCH | sudo tee /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist"

## WELCOME_RAMI_OPTIONS provides all options for the rami command in Welcome.
## The value can be set also by exporting this variable.
#
if [ -z "${WELCOME_RAMI_OPTIONS:-}" ] ; then
    WELCOME_RAMI_OPTIONS="--save"
    WELCOME_RAMI_OPTIONS+=" --timeout-rank 10"                    # use bigger value on slow connection, smaller value on fast connection
    WELCOME_RAMI_OPTIONS+=" --ranking-data --continent -cDE,US"   # reasonable defaults?
    WELCOME_RAMI_OPTIONS+=" -i acadielinux,k0.ae,lyrahosting,jtremesay,ungleich,sox.rs,urbanwave"  # too old!
